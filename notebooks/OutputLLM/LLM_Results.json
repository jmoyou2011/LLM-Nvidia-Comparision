During the reign of Louis XIV, the Sun King, the royal court moved to Versailles, and the Louvre became primarily a place to store and display the royal art collection.\n\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, the Louvre was opened to the public as a museum, becoming one of the first public museums in the world.

This style emerged in the mid-12th century, flourishing during the high and late medieval period. It evolved from the earlier Romanesque style, featuring several distinct characteristics that Notre-Dame exemplifies.\n\n1. **Pointed Arches**: Gothic architecture is known for its high, pointed arches. These arches distribute weight more efficiently than rounded ones, allowing for taller structures and larger windows. The intricate network of arches in Notre-Dame's interior is a testament to this architectural innovation.\n\n2. **Ribbed Vaults**: Notre-Dame's ceiling consists of ribbed vaults, another key feature of Gothic architecture. These vaults are formed by the intersection of two or three barrel vaults, creating a lightweight and flexible structure that can span large spaces.\n\n3. **Flying Buttresses**: External, arched supports called flying buttresses are a hallmark of Gothic design. They provide extra support to the thin walls and high ceilings, enabling the construction of taller, more slender structures. Notre-Dame's flying buttresses are a prominent feature of its exterior.\n\n4. **Large Stained Glass Windows**: The expansive stained glass windows of Notre-Dame are typical of Gothic architecture. These windows not only fill the interior with colorful light but also serve a religious function, often depicting biblical stories.\n\n5. **Detailed Sculptures and Gargoyles**: Notre-Dame is adorned with numerous sculptures, including gargoyles, which are decorative waterspouts.

However, with a little planning and preparation, you can easily get around the city using the efficient and extensive network of buses, trains, and subways. Here are some tips to help you navigate the Parisian public transportation system like a pro:\n\n1. Plan Your Route: Before you start your journey, plan your route in advance using the Paris transportation authority's website or a route-planning app like Citymapper or Google Maps. These tools can help you find the best route, avoiding traffic and construction, and providing real-time information on schedules and fares.\n2. Familiarize Yourself with the Metro: The Parisian metro is one of the most popular ways to get around the city. It's an extensive network of 16 lines that cover most areas of the city. Familiarize yourself with the metro map, and learn the basic rules of navigation, such as the direction of traffic flow and the location of stations.\n3. Use the Bus: The bus network in Paris is extensive, and it's a good option if you want to avoid the metro during rush hour or want to see the sights above ground. You can use the same route-planning apps or websites to find the best bus route for your journey.\n4. Buy a Paris Visite Pass: If you plan to use public transportation frequently during your stay, consider buying a Paris Visite Pass. This pass gives you unlimited access to the metro, bus, and RER (Express Regional Network) for a set period, starting at 10 euros per day.\n5. Understand the RER: The RER is a high-speed train network that connects the city center to the suburbs. It's a convenient way to get to the airport, Disneyland Paris, or other outlying attractions. The RER has five lines, and you can use the same ticket or pass as the metro and bus.\n6. Use the Velib: Velib is Paris's public bike-sharing system. It's a great way to get around the city, especially in areas with lighter traffic. You can rent a bike at one of the many stations across the city and return it to any station when you're done.\n7. Know the Operating Hours: Parisian public transportation operates from around 5:30 am to 12:30 am, Monday to Saturday. On Sundays and holidays, the metro and buses run on a reduced schedule.\n8. Be Aware of Peak Hours: Parisian public transportation can get crowded during peak hours (7:30-9:00 am and 4:30-6:30 pm). Try to avoid these times if possible, especially if you're traveling with a large group or luggage.\n9. Follow the Signs: Parisian public transportation stations can be a bit confusing, especially for non-French speakers. Look for signs that say \"Sortie\" (exit) or \"Correspondance\" (transfer) to navigate the stations.\n10. Ask for Help: If you're lost or confused, don't hesitate to ask for help from a station agent or a fellow passenger. Many Parisians speak English, and they'll be happy to assist you.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to navigate the Parisian public transportation system with ease and make the most of your time in this beautiful city."},{"model_name":"yi-34b","resp_time":0.245,"output_tokens":567,"prompt":"What are the best ways to navigate the Parisian public transportation system?","resp_msg":"The Parisian public transportation system, known as the R\u00e9gie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (RATP), is one of the most extensive and efficient in the world.

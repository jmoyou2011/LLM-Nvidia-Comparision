Its history is rich and complex, reflecting the cultural and artistic evolution of humanity.\n\nThe Louvre's origins date back to the 12th century when Philippe Auguste, King of France, built a fortress on the banks of the Seine River to protect Paris from Viking raids. This fortress evolved into a royal residence during the reign of Charles V in the 14th century. However, it was only in the 16th century, during the reign of Fran\u00e7ois I, that the idea of transforming the Louvre into a place to showcase art and culture emerged.\n\nFran\u00e7ois I, a great patron of the arts, invited many artists to the Louvre, including Leonardo da Vinci, who spent his final years there and completed the Mona Lisa. The king also commissioned new wings for the palace and began to assemble an art collection.\n\nThroughout the following centuries, successive French monarchs continued to expand the Louvre's architectural footprint and art collections. During the reign of Louis XIV, the Sun King, the royal court moved to Versailles, and the Louvre became primarily a place to store and display the royal art collection.\n\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, the Louvre was opened to the public as a museum, becoming one of the first public museums in the world. The new revolutionary government decided to nationalize all religious and royal art collections, significantly enriching the Louvre's holdings.\n\nThe museum's collections have continued to grow through donations, purchases, and archaeological expeditions. The Louvre's current structure is the result of numerous architectural campaigns and renovations, most notably the addition of the iconic glass pyramid designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei in 1989.\n\nToday, the Louvre Museum houses more than 380,000 objects and displays approximately 35,000 works of art, spanning various periods and civilizations, from ancient Egypt to modern Europe.

    "# Nvidia Foundational Large Language Models Async\n",
    "The Nvidia foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) are hosted on the catalog.ngc.nvidia.com webpage. Nvidia provides these models through either streaming or non-streaming process APIs for anyone to interact with many models. Nvidia provides an API key to developers to interact with these LLMs without a cost such as the OPENAI API and the rate-limiting of OPENAI. This allows new developers to experiment with LLMs with limited knowledge of the underlying architecture to obtain responses from prompts supplied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at 11 models that are labeled text-to-text models on their catalog. Since all the APIs for the models are the same except the last path item which is the uuid for the model. These APIs will be called using the Python requests module. Other request modules such as async with aiohttp, and httpx.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE\n",
    "There was experimentation with aiohttp with asyncio with the API calls. There are few issues discovered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some models will return a 200 status code instead of the expected 202. This required a rewrite to account\n",
    "   for this problem.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. This problem is variable as it is not consistent with a particular model. If you want to async\n",
    "   call the API for each model for a single prompt, one to a few of the models will return with an empty\n",
    "   response. The amount of models that return an empty response will vary with each call."
